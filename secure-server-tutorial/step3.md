Glad you made it! By now, we've set up a reverse proxy with Nginx and made sure that whatever local server we have running or whatever files we are serving, a client has to go through our reverse proxy to get their request fulfilled. That means a malicious attacker will not be able to trick us into accessing unauthorized content, and will have more difficulty finding and exploiting our API server. However, this does not mean we are out of the woods of a potential attack or getting attacked by DoS (Denial of Service). Sure, Nginx can help us prevent DoS attacks on our HTTP port (80) by blacklisting IP addresses or limiting the frequency of requests per client. But there's always a chance they might try and do this through another port.

Let's explain this notion of ports and how they can make our server vulnerable. Ports are like doors on the network to our server. Entities on other networks can gain access to certain services on your server either with TCP or UDP. When a computer opens a port, it means it's listening
